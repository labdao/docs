Small molecule binding affinity describes the strength of the interaction between a small molecule and a target, often a protein. The binding affinity of a small molecule and a protein can be described with three related metrics, ΔG (binding free energy), Kd (dissociation constant), or the IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration).

Generally, ΔG is considered the most generalisable metric to describe binding affinity, while the IC50 is an easy to measure, but highly context dependent metric. For each of these three metrics, a lower value implies a "tighter" interaction between the small molecule and target protein.

a molecular representation of the small molecule and protein on the left side, and the output values on the right side. In the middle would be an method or a model.
