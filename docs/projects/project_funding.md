# Funding Opportunities
After creating a project description and wallet we recommend to submit a grant proposal for your project. We have collected a set of funding opportunities for you in this section we recommend to take a look at. 

# [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/)

Gitcoin is on a mission to build an internet that is open source, collaborative, and economically empowering. So far, Gitcoin has provided over $72.8m funding to open source projects. Their most recent Decentralized Science round was in September, allocating $567k to projects.

Gitcoin grants are best for projects that are reimagining the incentives, culture, and infrastructure for research using web3 tools and technology. This includes projects that aim to create open source tooling for science. We recommend to explore the list of previously funded [projects](https://gitcoin.co/grants/clr/gr15-desci) and to get in touch with LabDAO-affiliated projects that were supported by Gitcoin:
* [Linguistic Informatics for Organizational Networks a.k.a. Project Lion](https://gitcoin.co/grants/7214/project-lion)
* [Rainforest monitoring](https://gitcoin.co/grants/7362/rainforest-monitoring-lab-by-gainforest-labdao-ra)
* [Open access longevity knowledge graph project](https://gitcoin.co/grants/7365/open-access-longevity-knowledge-graph-project)
* [Decentralized student team for iGEM competition](https://gitcoin.co/grants/7336/decentralized-student-team-for-igem-competition)

# [Protocol Labs](https://grants.protocol.ai/) & [Filecoin Foundation](https://fil.org/grants/)
![protocollabs 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37750378/212144472-42dcc264-44b8-4979-aa82-2d990d562249.png)

The Protocol Labs Research Grant Program aims to both support collaborative work on problems defined by the broader research community and drive progress on clearly scoped research projects critical to work at Protocol Labs.

Protocol Labs grants are best for projects that are aligned with Protocol Labsâ€™ mission to drive breakthroughs in computing to push humanity forward. The organization welcomes unique perspectives and diverse backgrounds. We recommend to explore the list of previously funded [projects](https://grants.protocol.ai/) and to get in touch with LabDAO-affiliated projects supported by the Protocol Labs ecosystem:
* [Rainforest monitoring](https://gitcoin.co/grants/7362/rainforest-monitoring-lab-by-gainforest-labdao-ra)
* [Linguistic Informatics for Organizational Networks a.k.a. Project Lion](https://gitcoin.co/grants/7214/project-lion)
* [Ocean monitoring](https://newatlantis.io/)

# [Amazon Webservices](https://aws.amazon.com/grants/) & [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/edu/researchers)

Cloud Provider grants program supports researchers who are using cloud computing resources to advance their work in various fields.

These grants are best for projects that have a serious need for compute infrastructure and are willing to use centralised cloud resources to support their research. Please make sure to use a .edu or .org email address, such as yourname@labdao.org, when applying for these research grants. Different from previous grants, cloud compute provider grants are emitted in the form of credits, and can not be used to cover other costs.
