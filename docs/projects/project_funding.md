# Funding Opportunities
After creating a project description and wallet we recommend to submit a grant proposal for your project. We have collected a set of funding opportunities for you in this section we recommend to take a look at. 

# [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/)
Gitcoin is on a mission to build an internet that is open source, collaborative, and economically empowering. So far, Gitcoin has provided over $72.8m funding to open source projects. Their most recent Decentralized Science round was in September, allocating $567k to projects.

Gitcoin is best for projects that are reimagining the incentives, culture, and infrastructure for research using web3 tools and technology. This includes projects that aim to create open source tooling for science. We recommend to explore the list of previously funded [projects](https://gitcoin.co/grants/clr/gr15-desci) and get in touch with LabDAO-affiliated projects that were supported by Gitcoin:
