# What are Projects?

We believe that projects, rather than labs, are the atomic unit of scientific progress. As a user of the LabDAO app, you can create a project and use your associated wallet address to raise funding on venues such as Gitcoin. This way, you can apply for scientific funding, no-matter your circumstance.

# Creating a Project

To create a new project within the LabDAO app, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the LabDAO app
2. Click on the "Create Project" tab
3. Fill in the necessary information about your project, including a project title, description, and any relevant tools you need.
4. Click "Create" to create your project.

# Using your Project in Grant Proposals

Once your project is created, you can create a grant proposal on different web3 funding platforms, to seek funding. You can use your wallet address on most of these platforms.

# Managing Your Project

Once your project is up and running, you can use the LabDAO app to manage various aspects of it, such as:
- Viewing a dashboard of project metrics, such as current funding
- Updating project information
- Inviting collaborators to your project (coming soon)
