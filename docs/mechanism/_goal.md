# Goal
The goal of openlab is to provide the infrastructure for the LabDAO community to grow and innovate. Historically, as communities have come together to allocate scarce resources, such as cost-intensive laboratory services or compute, markets have emerged. In addition, as communities grow, sub-groups organically emerge to lower the cost of communication and enable specialization. 

Today, two openlab products are in development: 
* **openlab exchange**
* **openlab teams**

New members within LabDAO are encouraged to -over time- form a team with community members that share the same interests and/or skills. Teams can work together to develop services and share them with the overall LabDAO community through the openlab exchange. Besides contributing open tools, teams can also come together to research new intellectual property which can lead to new organizations to emerge. The openlab teams product can facilitate the emergence of these inventor teams.
