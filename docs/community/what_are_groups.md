# What are Groups?
![](https://i.imgur.com/azu4V5k.png)

LabTeams is an organizational model for LabDAO that allows any member to launch a virtual laboratory (a "web-lab") within the LabDAO community. 

LabTeams allow members to self-organize in a structure that meets their needs and lets them focus on the topics they want to work on. Labs within LabDAO can be focused on both scientific fields (proteomics, representation learning) and operational tasks (graphic design). 

## What do Groups look like? 
Labs can come in several different forms, with the naming convention always being 'Topic Lab' (e.g. protein engineering lab, or webdesign lab). 

Generally labs are designed to be the home for 
**scientists**, **inventors** and **entrepreneurs** to come together and meet new labmates with similar interests and goals. 

Teams can also fulfill core operational roles within LabDAO, with groups emerging from current working groups such as a UX lab, a tokenomics lab etc. The current working groups (technology, community, coordination) now get to decide how best to segment their ongoing projects into smaller teams. 


## Who is part of a Group?
LabTeams are made up of about 7-10 labmates who (most often) find each other through the LabDAO community. Existing academic or industry labs that decide to join the community keep their existing structure, but might find additional digital labmates. 

The group should be aligned on their topic of interest but also aligned on the intentions of the LabTeam i.e. what short- and long-term plans they intend to work towards, for example open source tooling, scientific publications or company formation.

To kick off LabTeams, newly formed labs will be communicating with each other in open channels. As the labs solidify membership they will eventually move to closed channels to reduce overall Discord noise. 

Updates on a LabTeam's progress, any interesting findings and other relevant points will be shared during weekly cross-lab seminars and in relevant Discord channels. 

## Why Groups?
LabTeams enable open collaboration, decentralization and scientific progress. By giving scientists the framework to form and build their own communities online, this structure enables them to get concentrated work done in a way that makes sense to them. 

LabTeams self-organize. Each team uses an internal organizational model that makes sense for them. Members decide how work will be done, which member(s) will be leading the project, how much commitment is required to achieve the group's goals, and how any internal funding will be managed. The LabDAO core team supports team formation and will bring on trained mediators in case of conflicts. 

These LabDAO LabTeams, intentionally named in the '[team name] Lab' format, are lab spaces for experimentation and growth. Just like LabDAO, LabTeams is what their members make of them.
