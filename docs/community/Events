Everyone is welcome to join in to this casual chat. 


##  Project Overview Meetings

Once you’ve familiarized yourself with the LabDAO landscape, join the Project Overview Meeting to star doing some decentralized science. 
This hour-long call is a weekly meeting hosted in the #Contributors channel. LabDAO Stewards will discuss new LabDAO projects and ask interested scientists to reach out—this is where you can put your subject-specific skills to work. 
The meeting also involves progress updates on ongoing projects and presentations of research that was done. 
Even if you’re not ready to get involved, this call is a great way to get an idea of some of the work happening within the DAO.
