## So You Joined Our Server?

Welcome to the LabDAO discord server! 
This document will give you a quick introduction on how to optimize and personalize your Discord experience. 

Joining a new discord server will always be overwhelming—the big list of channels, new people to meet and dozens of ongoing conversations can feel like a lot. It can be hard to know where you fit in. 

This document will give you a quick tour and a good understanding of how to manage your experience. 

## Where to Start with LabDAO

* Ideally you'll have already completed our [onboarding](https://onboarding.labdao.xyz/quest) and found this document in the end of our start-here channels. 
* After that, find the #introductions channel and introduce yourself to the rest of the server.
* Once you've posted your intro message, go through the following steps to personalize the server so that you are only delivered the messages that interest you.

*Tip: Feel free to reach out to other LabDAO members about what channels you should look into based on your interests.You can also use the Discord search bar to see if topics of interest have come up in discussion alreay.*

## 1. Muting Channels 

There are a lof of channels and categories (groups of channels) in LabDAO that cover a broad range of topics. Many of these topics may not be of interest to you or involve teams you are a not a part of, and can be muted if needed. 

Muting channels and categories highlights activity from channels you actively want to follow while reducing unnecessary noise from other channels.

### Managing Channels and Categories
Left clikcing on a category will pull up the following menu:

Selecting the Mute Category option will hide all traffic from the channels in the category. 


The same process can be done by left clicking on individual channels:

We recommend that you do this to all channels that do not interest you—this will allow you to curate your LabDAO feed.

A white dot next to the LabDAO server icon (located on the far left side of the Discord app) indicates you have an unread message in an unmuted channel.

## 2. 'Mark As Read'

After you have finished muting channels, left click on the LabDAO server icon, and click 'Mark as Read' from the menu that appears.

This removes the white unread indicator from all channels and allows you to know immediately when a new message is sent to a channel you have decided to follow, as you will see a white dot next to the server icon and channel. 


## 3. Opting in to Notifications 

For a large public server such as LabDAO, Discord defaults to only sending users notifications when they are dircetly mentioned. This is good anti-spam protection, but you may want to be pinged by more messages from specific channels to be notified when team members post or your message has received a reply.

You can change your notification settings for a given channel by left clicking on it and navigating through the pop up menu.

The same thing can be done for the whole server but is not recommended.(This will result in you getting an audible 'ping' every time a message is sent.)

You will get this same ping when mentioned, replied too or directly messaged by default, as these are types of messages with heightened relevance. 

Admins rarely mass mention unless giving server wide annoucements, and other users may mention you if responding to one a question or looping you into a conversation of interest. We try and minimize spam and curate mentions such that messages are always relevant to the mentioned user. So we would encourage you to come back and check out messages that mention you.

## 4. Managing Direct Messages

As our public server has a few thousand users and many channels, its is easy for conversations to get lost. 

Direct Messages (DMs) are the best way for users to connect directly with eachother, form interest groups or reach out directly with questions to admins. Generally, having your DMs open in a public Discord can result in messages from spam-bots advertising crypto pump and dumps, but as of yet, LabDAO does not have this problem. Opening your DMs may be a good way to be introduced to the server.

### Opening/Closing DMs 

Left clicking on the server icon in discord will bring up the followign menu:

Selecting 'Privacy Settings' from this list gives one the option to open or close DMs to other members of the server. If you select "allow direct messages from server members" other LabDAO members will be able to reach out via direct message. Otherwise, a user will need to friend you prior to sending a message.

If you would like to DM someone, find their username either in a text channel or on the left side of the discord app. Left clicking on their user name and selecting 'Message' will open a DM. If this user has their DMs off, you will not see this option and must send them a friend request before being in a DM with them. Mentioning them or replying to a previous message may be a batter way to get into contact.
