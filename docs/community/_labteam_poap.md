# Making a LabTeam POAP

Congratulations on the formation of your new LabDAO group. In order to keep track of who is participating in your projects/group discussions we use POAPs for membership. 

Here are the instructions on how to create a LabTeam POAP.

## Create your image

Follow the instructions in [this Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/azMLXlKvrKW2TwowUa2O5o/LabTeam-POAP-generator?node-id=0%3A1) to create your POAP image.

(Contact LilyHG#3421 on Discord if you have any trouble with Figma)

## Create your POAP

1. [Create a new POAP](https://app.poap.xyz/admin/events/new)
2. "What are you commemorating?" LabDAO [your group] lab.
3. "What do you want people to remember about this drop?" 
    Briefly describe the reason your group has been created and what topic(s) you will be exploring. e.g. *"The Web3 Lab focuses on building and maintaining a permissionless infrastructure layer for the LabDAO community. Projects include smart contract development and blockchain querying via subgraphs."*
4. Select "Virtual drop" (no need to include location info)
5. Set the "Start Date" to the current date and the "Expiry Date" to one year from the Start Date. Make sure "Multi-day drop" is **not** selected.

7. Upload the POAP image you generated. *Note: You cannot change the image after the POAP has been created*. 
8. Copy the "Edit Code" and save it somewhere safe. 
10. Input your email.
11. "How many mint links do you need?" As a rule of thumb, it's good to start with 50 mint links. 
12. Save your POAP.
13. You'll recieve an email confirming your POAP has been sumitted for approval and should get a second email within 24 hours with two .txt attachments.
14. Download the "links.txt" attachment and create a 'Magic POAP QR Dispenser' [using these instructions](https://help.poap.xyz/en/articles/5908960-how-do-i-set-up-the-magic-poap-qr-dispenser-to-distribute-mint-links-via-unique-qr-codes). 
15. Only share the link to the POAP with individuals who have confirmed their interest in participating in the group.
