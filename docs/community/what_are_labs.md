# What are Labs?

LabTeams is an organizational model for LabDAO that allows any member to launch a virtual laboratory (a "web-lab") within the LabDAO community. 

LabTeams allows members to self-organize in a structure that meets their needs and lets them focus on the topics they want to work on. Teams -called Labs- within LabDAO can be focused on both scientific fields (proteomics, representation learning) and operational tasks (graphic design). 

## What do Labs look like? 
Labs can come in several different forms, with the naming convention always being 'Topic Lab' (e.g. protein engineering lab, or webdesign lab). 

Generally labs are designed to be the home for 
**scientists**, **inventors** and **entrepreneurs** to come together and meet new labmates with similar interests and goals. 

Teams can also fulfill core operational roles within LabDAO, with groups emerging from current working groups such as a UX lab, a tokenomics lab etc. The current working groups (technology, community, coordination) now get to decide how best to segment their ongoing projects into smaller teams. 


## Who is part of a Lab?
Labs are made up of about 7-10 labmates who (most often) find each other through the LabDAO community. Existing academic or industry labs that decide to join the community keep their existing structure, but might find additional digital labmates. 

The group should be aligned on their topic of interest but also aligned on the intentions of the LabTeam i.e. what short- and long-term plans they intend to work towards, for example open source tooling, scientific publications or company formation.

To kick off LabTeams, newly formed labs will be communicating with each other in open channels. As the labs solidify membership they will eventually move to closed channels to reduce overall Discord noise. 

Updates on a LabTeam's progress, any interesting findings and other relevant points will be shared during weekly cross-lab seminars and in relevant Discord channels. 

## Why LabTeams?
Independent labs enable open collaboration, decentralization and scientific progress. By giving scientists the framework to form and build their own communities online, this structure enables them to get concentrated work done in a way that makes sense to them. 

LabTeams enables self-organization. Each lab uses an internal organizational model that makes sense for members. Members decide how work will be done, which member(s) will be leading the project, how much commitment is required to achieve the group's goals, and how any internal funding will be managed. The LabDAO core supports lab formation and will bring on trained mediators in case of conflicts. 

These labs, intentionally named in the '[team name] Lab' format, are spaces for experimentation and growth. Just like LabDAO, Labs is what their members make of them.
