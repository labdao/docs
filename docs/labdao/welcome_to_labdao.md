# Welcome to LabDAO
LabDAO is a community of scientists and engineers coming together to share open tools for life science research. The community's mission is to accelerate progress in the life sciences by making both computational and wet-lab tools accessible to all its members.

Members within LabDAO implement algorithms and laboratory processes to offer them to community members on a peer-to-peer exchange. 

The project is pre-launch.
