## What is small molecule binding?
Small molecule binding is about exploring how a small molecule interacts with a target, often a protein.

A small molecule is brought into close contact with a target (either in silico or in the lab), and the goal is to determine:

* Does the small molecule interact and bind with the protein?
* If so, how strong is the interaction?

The strength of the interaction is referred to as the "binding affinity".

## What is the Small Molecule Binding Toolset?

We have put together a **curated, best-in-class toolset** for small molecule binding, which includes:

* [An introduction to small molecule binding and affinity prediction](/small-molecule-binding/introduction-to-small-molecule-binding)
* [An overview of the tools we provide (including docking and scoring)](/small-molecule-binding/tools)
* [A walkthrough example of running the tool and visualizing the results](/small-molecule-binding/run-an-example)
* [A step-by-step guide to running the tools with your own data](/small-molecule-binding/run-with-your-own-data)

Here is an overview of the package:
