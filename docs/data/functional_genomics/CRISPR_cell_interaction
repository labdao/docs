# Pooled CRISPR screen

```
input: genetic interaction subgraph
output: cell viability (numeric, scalar)
```

## DEPMAP
for cell state representation learning - gene expression and CRISPR score data
* gene level log2 TPM
* transcript level log2 TPM
* Salmon pseudoquantification

transcript gene relationship is known
gene gene relationship is sometimes known

## CRISPR aggregator 
gene expression and CRISPR score 
in some cases with modifier

# Perturb-Seq
