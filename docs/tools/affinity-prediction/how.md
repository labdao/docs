title: How to interpret Binding Affinity

Binding affinity data can be interpreted by comparing the ΔG, Kd, or IC50 values to a set of reference values for the target. References can be taken from previous experiments with known binders or by determining the binding affinity for a series of candidates and comparing them with eachother.

For all three binding affinity metrics, a smaller score indicates a stronger binding affinity. For example, a negative ΔG value, or a Kd or IC50 close to 0 indicate a strong interaction.

Predicting the binding affinity with machine learning models should be interpreted with additional care. It is important to consider the reported accuracy of these models, as well as their underlying training data, when reviewing results.
