title: Why determine Binding Affinity?

Determining the binding affinity of a small molecule and the intended target is an important step early in the drug discovery process. A strong binding affinity increases the probability that the clinical effect of the drug candidate is due to its interaction with the target, and not other structures within the organism. 

Determining the binding affinity of a drug candidate is important to understand its target and make informed downstream decisions that increase the probability of success throughout later phases of the drug discovery process. For example, retrospective analyses of clinical trial data suggest that: 
* clinical trials in which the target is known and genetic changes in the target are linked to differences in disease prevalence or outcome have a [>2x higher probability of success](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1008489).
* clinical trials for cancer drugs have a [>2x higher probability of success](https://globalforum.diaglobal.org/issue/may-2019/what-are-the-chances-of-getting-a-cancer-drug-approved/) if the group of patients included in the study have been pre-selected based on a biological feature (biomarker). These features often have a causal link to the drug target.
