There are several laboratory methods used to measure the binding affinity of a protein and small molecule. Popular, accurate and label-free methods include Surface-Plasmon-Resonance (SPR) and Bio-layer Interferometry (BLI). The cost of an average SPR experiment can range from several thousand dollars to tens of thousands of dollars, depending on the complexity of the experiment and the equipment used.
