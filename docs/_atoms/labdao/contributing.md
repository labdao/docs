## Community Charter
Open scientific tools and services are a public good. To maintain the free exchange of tools and services we strive to make our community adhere to the following articles: 
* The LabDAO community has a clear definition of membership. All owners of $LAB tokens are LabDAO members. Tokens are earned by contributing to the maintanance of open source tools, the LabDAO community or by using services on the openlab exchange. (Note: no token exists, the project is pre-launch)
* The governance decisions made within LabDAO are binding for its members.
* The members of LabDAO shape the governance process.
* The governance decisions made within LabDAO are enforced by the community or accountable delegates.
* The violation of governance decisions is followed by graduated sanctions.
* Conflicts within the community should be resolved within it using low costs.
* The growth of LabDAO will lead to the emergence of multiple nested daughter organisations, facilitated using the openlab teams framework.

## Code of Conduct at LabDAO

### Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open, collaborative, and welcoming environment, we pledge to making participation in our LabDAO projects and community a welcoming experience for everyone.

### We care 😊
- Ask for consent before sharing another community member’s personal information (including photographs) on social media.
- Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences. We are all here to learn from one another and a difference in opinion can present a good learning opportunity.
- Celebrate your accomplishments at events! (Get creative with your use of emojis 🎉 🥳 💯 🙌 !)
- Focus on what is best for the team and the community. (When in doubt, ask)
- Graciously accept constructive criticism, yet be unafraid to question, deliberate, and learn.
- Introduce yourself to members of the community. (We’ve all been outsiders and we know that talking to strangers can be hard for some, but remember we’re interested in getting to know you and your visions for open tools!)
- Show appreciation and **provide clear feedback**. (This is especially important because we don’t see each other in person and it can be harder to interpret subtleties. Also remember that not everyone understands a certain language to the same extent as you do, so **be clear in your communications to be kind.**)
- Take breaks when you feel like you need them.

### We frown on 😕
- “Doxing” i.e. posting (or threatening to post) another person’s personal identifying information online.
- Spamming or trolling of individuals on social media.
- Use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes and unwelcome sexual attention.

### Procedures for Reporting CoC violations

If someone makes you feel uncomfortable through their behaviours or actions, report it as soon as possible. You can reach out to members of the [LabDAO core team](https://discord.gg/labdao) and they will forward your concerns. Issues directly concerning members of the core team will be dealt with by other members of the core team and possible conflicts of interest will be taken into account. You can also contact the core team via e-mail at dao (at) labdao (dot) com.

All reports will be handled with utmost discretion and confidentially.
