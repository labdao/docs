### Poll

All arguments in this function must be contained in quotation marks for proper bot parsing, and are otherwise text strings.

No arguments provided after a question will default to Yes and No as two options to vote, however providing a question is mandatory. 

Providing multiple arguments will insert those arguments into the poll and have an emoji vote for each one.
