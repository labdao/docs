# Welcome to LabDAO?
LabDAO is a community of scientists and engineers coming together to share open tools for life science research. The community's mission is to accelerate progress in the life sciences by making both computational and wet-lab tools accessible for scientist online.

Members within LabDAO contribute to the our mission by onboarding models and laboratory services to offer them to community members on a peer-to-peer exchange. 

The project is pre-launch.
