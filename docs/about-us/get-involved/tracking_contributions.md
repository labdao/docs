# Coordinape

Coordinape is a tool for acknowledging contributions for a decentralized project such as LabDAO. This system is meant to ensure people across our large and decentralized team are compensated and credited fairly for their work.

Visit the Coordinape [website](https://coordinape.com) to learn more about the goals and philosophy behind this tool! (check out their medium article linked on the homepage as well)

## How does Coordinape work?

Work cycles on Coordinape are called ***epochs***, and usually span 1 month for LabDAO. At the end of each epoch, each member of the coordinape reflects on the work they have done and what others have contributed to the project. Each user is given 100 "GIVE tokens" per epoch that they can give to other members of the LabDAO team (called a *circle*). These serve as recognition of other user's contributions to LabDAO. Note that these are **not** on-chain tokens.

You may allocate give tokens for any reason, but it is expected everyone allocates based on which members they have **actively worked with** during the past epoch – proportional to the measurable impact of that user.

There are countless ways to contribute to LabDAO, but some examples are:

- Contributing code to our GitHub or other LabDAO projects
- Sharing ideas, aligning them with other contributors, and implementing them in a reproducible way
- Taking notes during meetings and making sure they are shared
- Starting or contributing to interesting and useful conversations on discord can even be a meaningful way to make a contribution!

Unallocated GIVE tokens do not roll over to future epochs, so be sure to allocate them before the end of each epoch! We try to post many reminders on discord leading up to that.

## Getting on Coordinape

Coordinape does not have open signups and requires being nominated by a user already in the coordinape circle.

To find a user to vouch for you, come to onboarding calls, interact with other members of the server, and ask around to see what projects could use your skillset!

You will use your ethereum wallet to sign in to coordinape.

## Setup Process

- New joiners to the circle must find an existing member to nominate them. 
- A name and a public ETH address must be provided for a nomination to be made. For info on how to make an ETH wallet,  look at the [MetaMask docs](https://www.followchain.org/make-metamask-wallet/#:~:text=How%20to%20make%20a%20MetaMask%20wallet.%201%201.,Wallet”.%205%205.%20Click%20on%20“Agree”.%20More%20items!)
- Any ethereum wallet with WalletConnect integration will work, we just recommend Metamask for anyone who is setting up a wallet for the first time
    
**Three** existing members must nominate/vouch for you in the coordinape app. You will need to give one of them your name and your public ethereum wallet address to be nominated, and then two additional members must vouch for you within 14 days. 

Vouching is done in the coordinape app. New members cannot see the graph or give/receive GIVE tokens until nominated and vouched for.

**Let your nominator know if you want your discord handle (or other pseudonym) used for coordinape, or your full name. It’s best to use whatever you go by in our community so people recognize you (adding a matching profile pic also helps!) This is mainly so users on Coordinape know who they are allocating GIVE to and can easily associate discord users to Coordinape Members.**

## Once you are approved

To see what is going on in the LabDAO Coordinape Cirle, first you must go to the [sign in page](https://app.coordinape.com/?open-wallet), where you will see a prompt to connect your wallet.

Click on whatever wallet option you provided to complete the vouching process. Sign in will only work if you connect with the wallet address you used for vouching, as access to that wallet will function as your login credentials for coordinape.

Once logged in, you will see all the circles you are a part of which at this point is probably just LabDAO. Selecting this circle and opting into the current Epoch will let you view other team members for you to select and allocate your give too. 

Make sure to update your profile and description so users can easily recognize you and associate you with the contribtuions you made on the discord side. But be sure to allocate prior to the end of the Epoch because give tokens are use them or lose them!

Don't be shy to ask any questions in the #coordinape channel in the LabDAO discord server if you run into any issues!
