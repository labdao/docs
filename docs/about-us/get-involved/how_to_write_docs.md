# Writing documentation

Writing documentation is a crucial part of any LabDAO project. The decentralized nature of a DAO means that without good documentation, contributing to the DAO is nearly impossible. To make writing useful documentation easier, here are some stylistic and technical notes on how we recommend doing it.

## Guidelines

## Editing existing documentation

Every page of this site ([docs.ladao.com](https://docs.ladao.com)) has an `Edit this page` link at the bottom. If there's anything you want to change about that page—from fixing typos, to adding key information, to removing incorrect instructions—click that link.

You'll be brought to a page on [GitHub](https://github.com) that prompts you to [fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).

Click `Fork this repository`. That will bring you to an editing page:

Our documentation is written in [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax), and the editor expects that you write in Markdown. Once you've finished making changes, scroll to the bottom of the editor window, fill in a message describing the changes you made, and click `Propose changes`.

This will prompt you to create a pull request.

Pull requests allow the core team to to easily compare your updates to the original documentation. We may ask you for additional changes, which you can make by going to the `Files` tab in your pull request, scrolling to the relevant file, and selecting `Edit file` from the menu like this:

You'll then be prompted to commit your new changes, which works the same way as the `Propose changes` step from earlier.

Once your changes have been reviewed and approved, they'll be merged into the main documentation repository and show up here on [docs.labdao.com](https://docs.labdao.com)! We appreciate any and all documentation contributions -- good documentation is what keeps this organization running.
