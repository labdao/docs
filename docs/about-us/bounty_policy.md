When applying to a bounty within LabDAO, for example through a platform that contains a **Task Description**, such as [DeWork](https://app.dework.xyz/labdao), you -referred to as Bounty Hunter- enter a **Bounty Agreement** with the following terms described below.

:::caution

LabDAO can only transfer funds to Bounty Hunters that are sending an invoice message upon completion of a task. Every invoice agreement needs to contain personal information such as the full name and address (described below). We recommend the use of a KYC'ed wallet, for example by using an on-chain [KYC token](https://humanbound.xyz/#mint).
