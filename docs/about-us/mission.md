# Mission
LabDAO's mission is to accelerate progress in the life sciences by making scientific tools more accessible.

We want to live in a world in which the ability to unleash one's scientific potential is not bounded by limited access to funding opportunities, infrastructure and distribution channels. We build tools that are designed to lower the barriers for inventors to raise funding, develop their technologies and distribute them. 

TLDR: We want to live in a world in which students drop out of school because they have developed a therapeutic candidate from their laptop, not yet-another instant checkout app. 

## The Problem
Open source code has accelerated progress in information technology over the last 20 years. This success is enabled by the ability to share code at low cost and to reproduce results with high reliability. In addition, the sharing of code is accelerated by technology market dynamics in which intellectual property is less relevant than the ability to execute, time to market, and trade secrets around implementation.

In contrast, open source in biomedicine is still waiting for its moment. The high cost of reproducing life science processes and the low reliability of generating expected results has slowed down progress. In addition, sharing instructions is hampered by intellectual property and trade secrets, the primary mode of defense against competitors during the lengthy regulatory approval processes seen in the life science industry.

While cloud compute providers remove the barrier to execute code by moving hardware online, there is no comparable layer of abstraction for dry-lab and wet-lab tools in biomedicine. We believe that an open source exchange for dry-lab and wet-lab tools could (1) help reduce the high costs created by secrecy around biomedical tooling, (2) increase reproducibility of biomedical tools, and (3) foster the emergence of independent entities that maintain open source tools. 

## The Solution
To accelerate progress, we enable scientists to share their specialized tools and services with eachother easily. Instead of going through a lengthy search for collaborators or service providers, researchers can discover tools and projects on an open exchange. 

* by creating an open exchange of wet-lab and dry-lab tooling
* by defining standards around biomedical tools to increase reproducibility and transparency
* by incentivizing contributors to develop applications and provide instrumentation

Cloud computing lowered the upfront cost of starting a new tech company; similarly, we are convinced openlab can spur a Cambrian explosion of new biotech companies. Existing [centralized cloud labs](https://www.emeraldcloudlab.com) for bio have not seen widespread adoption yet. We believe this is because of the high capital expenditure required to provide many laboratory services inhouse, the specialized level of equipment control, and the lack of an efficient pricing mechanism for these services. 

Decentralized cloud labs address these limitations by offering a diversity of laboratory services on a permissionless protocol. Market dynamics offer fast feedback and incentivize the right level of abstraction for service controls. DAO and token mechanism enable this marketplace to be owned by the community using it. 

The LabDAO will ensure the quality of services exchanged within its community using three mechanisms: 
1. Funds paid for transactions will be held in escrow until the user has reviewed the results coming from a purchased service. In case of conflict, an independent arbitration service can be called upon for settlement.
2. Participants on the openlab exchange need to stake $LAB tokens proportional to the value of transactions that they are offering and consuming. In case of fraudulent behaviour, the staked $LAB tokens can be slased by the community. 
3. The community is maintaing a list of trusted service providers that are participating in the exchange. The on-chain transaction record serves as a basis for user experience ratings.

The long term goals of LabDAO can be broken down into three stages: 
1. the introduction of the openlab marketplace will reduce the hurdles of using biomedical tools - with an initial focus on computational biology. 
2. the growth in transactions and rise in potential conflicts around service specifications will lead to the emergence of community-generated standards for biological services.
3. the on-chain record of transactions, including metadata and data assets, will function as a dynamically evolving knowledge graph - a global laboratory notebook.
