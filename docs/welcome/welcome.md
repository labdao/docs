## LabDAO intro and goals

LabDAO is an online organisation of scientists and engineers. 

Our goal is to make BioML tools more accessible and clinically relevant. 

We aim to unlock progress in the field, by breaking down barriers caused by poor usability and niche expertise.


## In the docs

We believe you shouldn't have to spend days researching and setting up BioML tools.

Our Plex client can be installed with 1 line of code. Plex allows you to run BioML tools direct from your command line, without having to worry about failing dependencies or managing compute.

In these docs, you can find:

- Curated, best-in-class pipelines
- Containerized tools that you can install and run straight away
- Step-by-step guides for the tools we support

## What to do next

- Check out our first toolset for [Small Molcule Binding Affinity Prediction](https://docs.labdao.xyz/affinity-prediction). 
This includes a workflow for docking small molecules & proteins, and for visualizing the results. **You can install Plex, run an example model, and visualize the results in less than 5 mins!**

- Find out more about our tools on our [website](https://labdao.xyz/tools).

- Get involved! If you'd like to help us containerize tools, or you want to explore a scientific collaboration, [you can get involved here](https://docs.labdao.xyz/about-us/get-involved/).
