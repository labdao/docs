## LabDAO Mission

LabDAO is an online organisation of scientists and engineers. Our goal is to make BioML tools more accessible and clinically relevant, to empower scientific inventors globally.

We want to live in a world where you can unleash your scientific potential, regardless of your age, career stage, background or existing organizational resources. For this to happen, a key step is to make the tools easier to use and understand, so more people can experiment and invent. 

TL;DR: We want to live in a world in which students drop out of school because they have developed a therapeutic candidate from their laptop, not yet another instant checkout app.


## In the docs

We believe you shouldn't have to spend days researching and setting up BioML tools.

In these docs, you can find:

- Curated, best-in-class pipelines for key drug discovery tasks e.g. Affinity Prediction
- Containerized tools that you can install and run straight away
- Step-by-step guides for the tools we support

:::note

We make these tools easy to use with our Plex client. Plex manages all the dependencies, drivers, and installations that these tools require, so you can run them straight away without set-up headaches. You can install Plex with 1 line of code.

## What to do next

- Check out our first toolset for [Small Molcule Binding Affinity Prediction](https://docs.labdao.xyz/affinity-prediction). 
This includes a workflow for docking small molecules & proteins, and for visualizing the results. **You can install Plex, run an example model, and visualize the results in less than 5 mins!**

- Find out more about our tools on our [website](https://labdao.xyz/tools).

- Get involved! If you'd like to help us containerize tools, or you want to explore a scientific collaboration, [you can get involved here](https://docs.labdao.xyz/about-us/get-involved/).
