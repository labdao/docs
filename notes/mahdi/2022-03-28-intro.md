# Intro to my LabDAO notebook

1. All pages will be prefixed by the date
2. Some days will just have the date page, all content in the date page
3. Some specific topics will be pulled into their own pages, still prefixed by initial writeup date of course

The first things I need to document are my LabDAO MolPAL notes.
